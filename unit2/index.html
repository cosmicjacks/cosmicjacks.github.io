		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by</h1>
		<p>I am most inspired by the websites <a href="http://www.latimes.com/">latimes.com</a> and the magazine.good.is</p>
		<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
		<p>I like how these sites balance the positive and negative space which prevents the feeling of clutter. The feature story is highlighted in both websites by its size in relationship to other stories. Therefore this feature story also serves as the focal point for each website. Lastly, both of these pages are incredibly pleasant to the eye yet its messages are clearly communicated. Also, by repeating features stories that use large blocks of photograps as well as text boxes for minor stories, these websites exhibit balance.  They almost mimic holding a real newspaper or a real magazine.</p>
		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
		<p>They are  similar in that they both have their own print forms available. Therefore they tend to mimic their print formats. They also have an irregular grid system going on which creates an interesting website to look at. They are different in that Good plays with different ways to lay our their articles whereas the LA times sticks to its newspaper format.</p>
		<h1>Thumbnail Sketches</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Aspirational Website</strong></li>
		<p>This hand drawn website demonstrates focal point by emphazing the side column which organizes the website as well as the focal point by emphasizing the feature story. This website also uses hierarchy by putting emphasis on breaking or important news stories with vivid photogaphs and striking fonts. The balance comes in with the interplay of thesize of the photographs in relationship to their importance.</p>

		<li><stong>Backup Website</stong></li>
		<p> My backup website uses one strong feature story as the entire focal point. Afterwards, hierarchy is aso created by the size of the photos which represent different stories in relation to their importance. The balance is seen through the colloboration between the positive and negative space which avoids clutter.</p>
